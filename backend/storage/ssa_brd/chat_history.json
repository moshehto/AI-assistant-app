    "content": "Scope of Project   The project will focus on implementing AWS cloud-based infrastructure for SSA\u2019s satellite data management needs. The primary components include: Computational Power: Amazon EC2 instances for data processing. Storage: Amazon S3 for storing raw and processed satellite data. Release 1: Deployment of infrastructure, installation of Open Data Cube, and provisioning of the following datasets: Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and Landsat 9. Release 1: Deployment of infrastructure, installation of Open Data Cube, and indexing of datasets for the Proof of Concept (POC) use case. This phase will focus on a limited geographic region and a specific application to validate system functionality. The following datasets will be provisioned: Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and Landsat 9. Release 2: Expansion to a fully functional use case, scaling dataset coverage beyond the initial POC region. This phase will refine data indexing, enhance processing capabilities, and incorporate additional datasets and analytical tools based on stakeholder needs."
